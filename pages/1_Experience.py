        My major responsibility was to grow and lead a data science team in Berlin and transform it into an autonomous 
        and functional unit of the organization. The strategic deliverable was to develop multiple machine learning 
        systems to drive pricing products available in the rider and driver apps. Deliverables also encompassed driving 
        other data science initiatives to empower mobility products including marketing. 
        These products were used by riders across Europe. A few of the responsibilities included

        - Providing technical leadership besides assisting the senior management with the data strategy.
        - Defining the vision and goals including outlining the technical roadmap of the data science team.
        - Design, implement, and release pricing-focused data products driven by machine learning. 
        - Taking ownership of existing non-operational data science artifacts and operationalizing them through 
        microservice architecture.
        - Design and development of modeling pipeline for training, evaluation, deployment, and monitoring.
        - Serve as a hands-on machine learning engineer involved in system design and leading SDLC.
        - Align with product and engineering teams to create strategic analytics-based offerings.
        - Orchestrate technical collaborations with multiple stakeholders to facilitate data value delivery.
        - Knowledge sharing with the business analytics team to promote and enhance data literacy. 
        - Enhance the MLOps maturity within the data science team.

        As an individual contributor, I was mainly responsible for machine learning initiatives, building and 
        integrating data science artifacts with the software products including recommendation systems and relevance 
        sorting. These products and features are being used by users of top online travel agencies in Europe.
        Machine learning algorithms and heuristics lie at the core of these products which uplifted the revenue and 
        user engagement KPIs compared to baselines. Major responsibilities included
         
        - Engagement in product development lifecycle while working hands-on within the engineering teams from data 
        product inception, design, and prototyping to rolling out to clients.
        - Predictive modeling of online user behaviors using supervised and unsupervised learning e.g. booking 
        prediction, churn prediction, budget prediction, interactivity score, user focus predictions, and user's LTV. 
        - Product DNA modeling for hotels, vehicles, and regions by applying various ML algorithms.
        - Implementation of data product experimentation based on A/B tests and multi-armed bandits.
        - Implementation of data productâ€™s performance benchmarks and feedback loop to the learning system.
        - Responsible for designing, implementing, and testing the ETL pipeline, focusing on data selection, 
        preprocessing, and transformation while ensuring data quality. 
        - Simulation, training, evaluation, model selection, and deployment of machine learning models.
        - Descriptive analysis of deployed models for quality assurance and avoiding data distribution drift.

        As an individual contributor, I have worked in marketing intelligence using big data analytics and machine
        learning. I developed a probabilistic mapping of consumer online behavior using descriptive and predictive 
        analytics for more than 100 million internet users worldwide using multi-terabytes of click-stream. 
        Some key assignments included 

        - Unsupervised clustering algorithms to find similar websites over the internet.
        - Topic modeling algorithms over website content combined with customers' journey mappings.
        - Computing the socio-demographics of internet users based on their browsing patterns expediting supervised and 
        unsupervised machine learning algorithms and heuristics.
        - Binary classification of URLs as conversion points originating from the e-commerce sector.
        - SEO recommendations using search keywords trend using search engine query parameters.
        - Computing standard web metrics like page views, page visits, unique visitors, and bounce rates.
        - Trend forecasting of web metrics using statistical models e.g. ARIMA models. 
        - Estimating user session duration per website and source/sink domains per website.
        - Web scraping online data sources to be used as a source of truth for performance evaluation of various 
        marketing intelligence metrics.
